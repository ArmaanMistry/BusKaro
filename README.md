## The Problem it solves...
The majority of bus transportation systems lack comprehensive digitalization, leading to several issues. These include
- limited real-time passenger count information,
- inadequate fire safety measures,
- ineffective emergency response coordination,
- prevalent theft and security concerns without proper surveillance,
- and the absence of temperature monitoring inside buses.
To modernize bus transportation effectively, these challenges must be addressed through comprehensive digital transformation initiatives.

As a solution, we propose the development of a comprehensive digital ecosystem for bus transportation. This includes 
- creating a user-friendly mobile application for passengers to access real-time bus information,
- a secure web portal for management to monitor and optimize management,
- and integrating IoT devices on buses for data collection and for safety measures.
By leveraging these technologies, we aim to enhance the overall experience for passengers, improve safety measures, and increase the efficiency of bus transportation systems.
